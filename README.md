 GitHashingExercise is a repository created for an exercise to demonstrate Git and basic hashing operations.
 The project includes a script (hash_script) that takes a 4-digit integer as input, generates a hash using SHA-256, and saves the output to a file (hash_output.txt).
 Additionally, there's a C program (mysigcatch.c) that catches the SIGINT signal, prints a message, and terminates gracefully.
The modified version (mysigcatchmodified.c) uses a custom signal handler and restores the default behavior after catching SIGINT twice.
